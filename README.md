# A MonoRepo style repository for Quarkus and CICD demos

Inspired by the work of [community](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot) and [colleague](https://github.com/gnunn-gitops/standards/blob/master/folders.md), this experimental MonoRepo style repository captures code for Application, Deployment and Operation. It serves as an ignition key to start (bootstrap) a lightweight Command Center Cluster which is the core component of a larger Control Plane, and manage and distribute workloads to a broader Data Plane which may be in a single or multi cluser setup.
